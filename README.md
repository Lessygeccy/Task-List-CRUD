Task To-Do

This website allows you to create a list of To-Do Tasks.

Each to-do task has its own designated level of importance.

The red circle represents the highest level of importance.
A triangle with an exclamation sign is for medium or average level. Lastly, the green circle, indicates that the task has the lowest level of importance. 

The tasks assigned with the highest level of importance are automatically pinned at the top and followed by the medium and the lowest.

The name of the tasks can be edited as well as the level of importance. 

Lastly, tasks can be marked as completed and deleted with or without marking them as done from the list.
